    Coding is not for me just learning how it works. 
    You also learn how to solve problems, help others, work together with others, and communicate well.
    I love doing it and the more I do it, the better and more useful it gets. 
    The moment I work with it, I also see the changes I make every time. 
    That's what makes programming so much fun too thin. 
    You see your own work constantly changing and getting better.
